# _Jon's First Webpage_

##### _Jon Nardine's first attempt at creating a webpage, 9/11/2015_

#### By _**Jon Nardine**_

## Description

_This is Jon Nardine's first attempt at making a website, using principles learned about HTML, CSS, Markdown, and uploaded onto Github.com. The website includes a picture of Jon, a list of his favorite websites, his favorite activities, a brief history of Jon himself, and his hobbies._

## Setup

_Please visit this website:_

https://github.com/jwnardine/MyFirstWebpage

_Not sure what to put here at this point, mainly because accessing index.html seems like a simple procedure which does not involve numerous steps, and all I have to offer are index.html, the CSS modifiers, and the README.md._

## Technologies Used

_HTML (Atom), CSS (Atom), Markdown, Github_
